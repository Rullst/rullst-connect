# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Maintenance
- **Dependabot Bumps**: Updated GitHub Actions workflows (`github/codeql-action` to `v4.37.3`, `ossf/scorecard-action` to `v2.4.4`, `actions/configure-pages` to `v6.0.0`, `actions/upload-pages-artifact` to `v5.0.0`, and `EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny-action` to `v2.1.1`). Also bumped `base64` crate from `0.22` to `0.23`.

## [11.0.0] - 2026-07-15

### Breaking Changes
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: All `redirect_url` and `issuer_url` declarations now strictly require `https://`. An exception has been added for development environments running on `http://localhost` and `http://127.0.0.1`. Applications using plain `http://` in production or tests will fail during provider initialization.

### Performance
- **JWKS Cache Optimization**: Improved `JWKS_CACHE` to store `Arc<JwkSet>` instead of the full JSON structure. This eliminates deep cloning during cache hits and reduces memory allocations under high concurrent OIDC authentication load.
- **Client Allocations**: Reduced heap allocations (`String`) during `HttpRequest` construction by leveraging `Cow<'static, str>` for HTTP methods, and optimized error allocations in the fallback path.

### Security
- **Timing Attack Mitigation**: Secured `verify_nonce` and `verify_state` against potential length-based timing attacks by hashing inputs using `SHA256` before applying constant-time comparisons.
- **Strict JSON Serialization Errors**: Replaced `unwrap_or_default()` in HTTP client with strict error handling (`map_err`) to avoid accidentally sending empty bodies on payload serialization failures.

### Fixed
- **Mock Provider Panics**: Removed `unimplemented!()` panics in `SimpleProvider` and `FailingUserProvider` mock structs, replacing them with explicit `ConnectError` returns to improve stability in testing environments.

### Added
- **Test Coverage**: Added test coverage for `HttpClientExt` helper methods (`.get()` and `.post()`), `basic_auth` requests, fallback HTTP mapping, JWKS caching flow, and `with_http_client`/`with_retry` builder methods.
- **Mock IDP Coverage**: Added tests for valid authorization and token exchange paths in the end-to-end `mock_idp` utilities.

## [10.0.5] - 2026-07-05

### Security
- **CI/CD Credential Protection**: Added a new TruffleHog GitHub Actions workflow to block leaked secrets and API keys in Pull Requests before they are merged.
- **JWT Algorithm Confusion Mitigation**: Hardened the generic `OidcProvider`, `AppleProvider`, and `GoogleProvider`'s `id_token` validation to strictly enforce asymmetric cryptographic algorithms (e.g., `RS256`, `ES256`). This patches a critical vulnerability where an attacker could bypass signature checks by providing a symmetric algorithm (like `HS256`) or `none` in the token header.
- **SLSA Level 3 Build Provenance**: Added official GitHub Actions workflow steps to generate verifiable SLSA Level 3 build provenance attestations for crates published to crates.io. Added the SLSA Level 3 badge to the README.

### Added
- **Extractors Edge Case Testing**: Added explicit test case ensuring `AuthCallback::verify_state` returns `ConnectError::InvalidState` when the `state` parameter is completely missing.
- **Secret Deserialization Testing**: Added test coverage for `Option<SecretString>` custom serde deserialization.
- **Prelude Testing**: Added compilation tests for the library's `prelude` module to ensure all re-exports remain accessible.
- **Mock Implementations**: Filled out `get_user` and `get_user_from_token` in `DummyProvider` with valid mock data to prevent accidental panics in consumer tests.

### Maintenance
- **Dependabot Bumps**: Updated multiple GitHub Actions workflows to their latest stable versions (`actions/checkout@v7.0.0`, `codecov/codecov-action@v7.0.0`, `actions/cache@v6.1.0`, and `github/codeql-action@v4.36.3`).

## [10.0.4] - 2026-06-28

### Fixed
- **Mutation Testing Resilience**: Eliminated all 19 surviving `cargo-mutants` mutants by hardening the test suite:
  - **`src/client.rs`**: Added precise boundary tests for the 2 MiB response body size limit (`test_body_size_limit_exceeded`, `test_body_size_limit_exact_boundary_succeeds`), verifying both that over-limit bodies are rejected and that exact-limit bodies are accepted. Added `test_retry_branch_headers_are_forwarded` to kill the `delete !` mutant on the `!req.headers.is_empty()` guard in the retry branch. Strengthened `test_reqwest_client_new_with_retry_is_distinct_from_default` to use heap address comparison instead of a trivial existence check.
  - **`src/extractors.rs`**: Added explicit assertions to `test_verify_state` covering prefix-length mismatches (`== vs !=` mutant), same-length / different-content mismatches (`&& vs ||` mutant), and the `Ok(())` replacement mutant. Added `test_axum_extractor_values_are_from_query` and expanded `test_actix_extractor` to assert that real query-string values are returned, killing the `Ok(Default::default())` mutant on both framework extractors. Added `test_axum_session_extractor_carries_real_values` and `test_axum_session_extractor_length_mismatch_rejected` to cover the `AuthSession` replacement and logical-operator mutants.
  - **`src/providers/auth0.rs`** and **`src/providers/google.rs`**: Strengthened `test_auth0_with_retry` and `test_google_with_retry` to additionally assert that the new `http_client` is not pointer-equal to the global `DEFAULT_HTTP_CLIENT`, killing the `replace with_retry -> Self with Default::default()` mutant that previously escaped the weaker `ptr_eq` check.
- **`cargo fmt` Compliance**: Fixed formatting regressions introduced by the previous release, ensuring `cargo fmt -- --check` passes on CI.

## [10.0.3] - 2026-06-28

### Added
- **Property-based Testing**: Added `proptest` to development dependencies and introduced property-based tests for PKCE challenge generation.
- **Provider Tests**: Added missing test `test_exchange_and_get_user_fetch_user_fails` to properly cover partial token exchange failures where network succeeds but user-fetching fails.

### Changed
- **Performance Optimization**: Replaced instance-level `OnceCell` JWKS caches in `AppleProvider`, `GoogleProvider`, and `OidcProvider` with a global `LazyLock<RwLock<HashMap>>`. This eliminates redundant public key fetches on every request and prevents rate-limiting issues when instantiating providers dynamically in web frameworks like Axum.

## [10.0.2] - 2026-06-24

### Added
- **Quality & Security Pipeline**:
  - Replaced `cargo-audit` with `cargo-deny` for comprehensive vulnerability, license, and ban checks.
  - Added `cargo-llvm-cov` for accurate, LLVM-based code coverage.
  - Integrated `cargo-mutants` for mutation testing to ensure robust test assertions.
  - Configured GitHub CodeQL for automated taint analysis and static application security testing (SAST).
  - Configured `Miri` in CI to automatically test for Undefined Behavior and memory safety.
  - Configured `cargo-fuzz` CI infrastructure with a manual trigger and a strict 6-hour timeout to prevent runner exhaustion.
  - Added `cargo-semver-checks` workflow to enforce SemVer compliance in PRs and prevent accidental breaking changes.
  - Added `cargo-machete` workflow to enforce removal of unused dependencies.
  - Added `cargo-spellcheck` workflow to catch spelling and grammar errors in documentation.
  - Added `cargo-kani` workflow to automate mathematical proofs via Kani Rust Verifier.
  - Configured GitHub Dependabot for automated weekly updates on crates and GitHub Actions.
  - Added `criterion`, `loom`, and Kani verifier as development dependencies for microbenchmarking, concurrent async testing, and formal verification.
  - Refactored `provider_bench` to use the `Criterion` framework.
- **Test Coverage (94%)**:
  - Achieved ~94% line coverage globally.
  - Added exhaustive unit tests for network failure paths (HTTP 400 Bad Request, invalid JSON) and missing fields (missing `id_token`, `access_token`) across providers.
  - Added tests for `Provider` trait default methods (`request_device_code`, `refresh_token`, `revoke_token`, `poll_device_token`).
- **OIDC Provider**: Implemented the missing `refresh_token` trait method.

## [10.0.1] - 2026-06-19

### Changed
- **Dependencies**: Bumped `secrecy` requirement to `0.10` and `actions/checkout` to `v7` in GitHub Actions workflows.

## [10.0.0] - 2026-06-18

### [BREAKING CHANGE]
- **`build_oauth_params` Signature Change**: The signature of the public helper function `rullst_connect::provider::build_oauth_params` has been updated to accept `base_url` as `&str` and `scopes` as `&str` (previously `String` and `&[String]`). This eliminates cascading heap allocations during URL generation. Developers implementing custom providers using this helper must update their calls to pass string references. The primary user-facing builder API (`with_scopes`) is completely unaffected.

- **`HttpRequest` Form Type**: The `form` field in `rullst_connect::client::HttpRequest` has been changed from `Vec<(String, String)>` to `Option<String>`. This breaking change allows providers to serialize form data directly into a single pre-allocated string (using structures like `TokenExchangeForm`), completely eliminating dynamic vector and string allocations during token exchanges. Custom HTTP client implementations must be updated to accept the pre-serialized string.

- **Token Type Safety (`secrecy` Crate)**: All provider constructors now require `secrecy::SecretString` for the `client_secret` parameter, instead of `String`. Furthermore, the `access_token` and `refresh_token` fields inside the `ConnectUser` universal profile struct have been changed to `SecretString`. Developers interacting with these tokens must now call `.expose_secret()` or `.expose_secret().as_str()` to read the raw string values. This is an architectural boundary introduced to prevent accidental credential logging.

### Performance
- **Zero-Allocation JSON Parsing**: The HTTP client now parses API responses directly from the byte buffer using `serde_json::from_slice`, completely bypassing the redundant UTF-8 validation pass and the intermediate `String` allocation that `String::from_utf8` previously caused.
- **Zero-Allocation Token Exchanges**: Introduced `TokenExchangeForm` across all OAuth providers. This static struct uses `serde` to efficiently serialize form data directly into the HTTP request body without intermediate `Vec` or `String` allocations on the hot path.
- **Atomic Session Extraction**: Optimized the Axum `AuthCallback` extractor to use `session.remove()` directly instead of sequentially calling `session.get()` followed by `session.remove()`. This cuts backend I/O operations (e.g., Redis or database calls) in half during the OAuth callback phase.
- **Global Connection Pooling**: Centralized HTTP client instantiation by introducing a globally shared `reqwest::Client` (via `LazyLock`) in `src/client.rs`. This prevents each provider from creating its own isolated connection pool, dramatically reducing memory overhead, DNS lookups, and thread spawning in multi-provider environments.
- **URL Serialization**: Optimized `redirect_url` string allocations across all providers by preventing unnecessary `format!()` concatenations and leveraging `url::form_urlencoded::Serializer::for_suffix` to safely append queries directly to the base URL without duplicate memory allocations.
- **Pre-joined Scopes**: Provider scopes are now pre-joined into a single `String` at provider initialization time rather than being dynamically allocated and joined as a `Vec<String>` on every authentication request, drastically reducing allocations in the hot path.
- **OIDC ID Token Fast-Path**: Optimized `OidcProvider` token exchange to properly utilize `get_user_from_form` (which parses and cryptographically validates the returned `id_token`) instead of blindly falling back to the generic token exchange. This saves a full network roundtrip to the `/userinfo` endpoint for OIDC providers that embed claims directly in the `id_token`.
- **Lazy JWKS Fetching (`OidcProvider`)**: Optimized `OidcProvider::discover` to no longer eagerly fetch the JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) during provider initialization. It now stores the `jwks_uri` and leverages `tokio::sync::OnceCell` to fetch the public keys lazily upon the first actual token validation. This eliminates a blocking external network call from application startup, significantly decreasing initial boot and discovery latency.
- **Request Body Allocation**: Removed an unnecessary `String` clone during internal HTTP requests by fully consuming the `HttpRequest` struct when assigning request bodies, slightly improving runtime performance during token exchanges.
- **URL Capacity Pre-allocation**: Optimized OAuth2 URL extension methods (`redirect_url_with_state`, `redirect_url_with_pkce`, etc.) to use `.reserve()` and pre-allocate string capacity. This prevents dynamic `String` re-allocations on the heap when appending query parameters to the base URL returned by providers.
- **PKCE Verifier Allocation**: Optimized PKCE `code_verifier` random string generation by pre-allocating an exact 64-byte `String::with_capacity` and utilizing `.extend()`. This guarantees a single allocation, removing hidden `Vec` re-allocation steps previously caused by `.collect()` on unknown-length random iterators.
- **HeaderMap Memory Optimization**: Refactored internal `HttpRequest` to utilize `reqwest::header::HeaderMap` rather than `Vec<(String, String)>`. This shifts the `builder.header()` pattern to accept `&str` instead of `impl Into<String>`, eliminating unnecessary `String` heap allocations and avoiding duplicated strings for static headers like `Accept` and `User-Agent`.
- **Header Parsing Fast-Path**: Replaced `.to_str()` and `.parse()` with direct ASCII byte manipulation (`.as_bytes().iter().try_fold(...)`) when parsing the `Content-Length` header. This completely eliminates UTF-8 validation overhead and `String` allocations for this common numeric header, squeezing out extra CPU cycles during the HTTP response parsing hot-path.
- **Compile-Time Scope Concatenation**: Replaced runtime `["a", "b"].join(" ")` array allocations with the `concat!` macro in the `define_provider!` macro. This shifts the concatenation of default OAuth2 scopes entirely to compile-time, converting them into a single static string literal and eliminating dynamic heap allocations and iteration overhead every time a provider is initialized.

### Security
- **JWT Algorithm Confusion Bypass**: Patched a critical security vulnerability in `GoogleProvider`, `AppleProvider`, and `OidcProvider` where the `id_token` signature verification blindly trusted the `alg` specified in the unverified JWT header. The validation logic now strictly enforces asymmetric cryptographic algorithms (e.g. `RS256`), completely mitigating attacks where a malicious actor injects symmetric algorithms (like `HS256`) to bypass signature checks using known public keys.
- **OOM Protection (Body Capacity Cap)**: Added a hard cap (`min(MAX_BODY_SIZE)`) to the pre-allocated `Vec::with_capacity` buffer derived from the `Content-Length` header. This prevents an attacker from spoofing a massive `Content-Length` (e.g. 10GB) and crashing the application with an Out-of-Memory (OOM) panic before the body stream is even read.
- **Provider API Error Sanitization**: Implemented truncation (maximum 512 characters) for error messages parsed from provider APIs in `HttpClient`. This prevents potential sensitive information exposure and prevents log spam / DoS if an upstream provider or gateway returns massive payloads (like a 100KB HTML Cloudflare error page) inside an HTTP failure.
- **OIDC Nonce Timing Attacks**: Hardened OpenID Connect (OIDC), Google, and Apple providers against timing side-channel attacks during ID token validation. The `nonce` claim is now verified using constant-time comparison via `subtle::ConstantTimeEq` instead of standard string equality. Added strict enforcement requiring the `nonce` claim to be present in the JWT when expected.
- **Constant-Time Panic (DoS) Mitigations**: Fixed multiple Denial of Service vulnerabilities where attackers could crash the application by sending tokens or `state` strings of a different length than expected. The `subtle::ConstantTimeEq` trait panics on slices of unequal length. A strict pre-validation length check was added before executing constant-time equality in `AuthCallback::verify_state`, the Axum `AuthSession` extractor, and the OIDC `nonce` validation logic for Google, Apple, and generic OIDC providers.
- **Log Leakage & Token Exposure Prevention**: Deeply integrated the `secrecy` crate into the core library architecture. Highly sensitive fields like `client_secret`, `access_token`, and `refresh_token` are no longer raw `String` types; they are now strongly typed as `secrecy::SecretString`. This guarantees that tokens cannot be accidentally leaked via `dbg!()`, `println!()`, standard application logs, or panic traces (they display as `[REDACTED]`). It also enforces safe memory-zeroing when the variables are dropped.
- **Short-Lived Apple Client Secrets (Defense in Depth)**: Hardened `AppleProvider`'s dynamic `client_secret` JWT generator. The expiration (`exp`) claim for the internally generated authentication token was drastically reduced from 30 days (2,592,000 seconds) to just 5 minutes (300 seconds). Since a new JWT is generated strictly at the moment of each token exchange, this minimizes the attack surface to a negligible window if a token is ever intercepted.
- **SSRF & Open Redirect Mitigation (`OidcProvider`)**: Hardened the OIDC discovery process by explicitly enforcing URL scheme validation (`http`/`https`) on both the `issuer_url` and `redirect_url` provided by the developer at runtime. This mitigates Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) and Local File Inclusion vulnerabilities where an attacker could theoretically provide an internal metadata IP (`http://169.254.169.254`) or local file path (`file:///`) dynamically.

## [9.0.1] - 2026-06-18

### Security
- **Hardcoded Credentials**: Removed hardcoded dummy credentials from Axum examples (`axum_example.rs` and `axum_server.rs`), replacing them with environment variable reads (`std::env::var`) to promote secure configuration practices.

### Performance & Maintenance
- **Form Allocation Optimization**: Replaced array slicing `.form(&[...])` with standard arrays `.form([...])` across all providers to reduce unnecessary borrowing overhead.
- **Header Construction**: Optimized `HeaderMap` construction in `ReqwestClient` to safely use `try_from` without panicking on invalid headers.
- **Redundant Clones**: Removed unnecessary `.clone()` calls on the access token in the `GoogleProvider` token exchange.
- **Macro Hygiene**: Fixed macro hygiene issue by properly scoping `#[allow(dead_code)]` in the `define_provider` macro to avoid triggering `unused_attributes` warnings in recent Rust compilers.

### Added
- **Unit Tests**: Added robust tests for `ConnectUser` serialization and deserialization.
- **Unit Tests**: Added tests for the `Connect::driver` dynamic provider factory method.
- **Unit Tests**: Added endpoints tests for the `mock_router` discovery and userinfo handlers in `mock_idp.rs`.

## [9.0.0] - 2026-06-17

### Changed (Breaking)
- **Provider API Unification**: Replaced the redundant `get_user(auth_code: &str)` and `get_user_with_pkce(...)` methods on the `Provider` trait with a single, unified `get_user(params: ExchangeParams)` method. This future-proofs the API and handles `auth_code`, `code_verifier`, and `expected_nonce` in one struct.

### Security
- **OIDC Nonce Validation**: Implemented cryptographic validation for the `nonce` claim in `GoogleProvider`, `AppleProvider`, and `OidcProvider`. The `ExchangeParams` struct now accepts an optional `expected_nonce` to prevent replay attacks during OpenID Connect flows.
- **PKCE Enforcement**: Fixed an issue where the `code_verifier` was correctly accepted by `get_user_with_pkce` but incorrectly omitted from the final token exchange POST request across multiple providers (Cognito, LinkedIn, GitHub, OIDC, Apple, Discord, Microsoft, Facebook).

### Added
- **Unit Tests**: Added comprehensive mock client testing for the `GithubProvider` to verify mapping of GitHub profile attributes.
- **Unit Tests**: Added initialization tests for `ReqwestClient::new_with_retry` under the `retry` feature flag.
- **Unit Tests**: Added missing coverage for the generic `fetch_access_token` and `fetch_refresh_token` helper methods in `src/provider.rs`.

### Performance
- **Optimized JSON Parsing**: Refactored the `GoogleProvider` token exchange to deserialize directly into a strongly-typed struct (`GoogleTokenResponse`) instead of the generic `serde_json::Value`, avoiding unnecessary allocations.

## [8.0.0] - 2026-06-15

### Changed (Breaking)
- **Pruning**: Removed 25 low-usage/unmaintained providers to focus the library completely on the 11 most robust, heavily-used core providers: Google, GitHub, Microsoft, Apple, Auth0, Cognito, Facebook, X, Discord, LinkedIn, and OIDC.
- **Security (PKCE)**: Upgraded the `Provider` trait to uniformly require PKCE natively on all providers. Implemented `get_user_with_pkce` enforcing authorization code interception attack mitigations.
- **Architecture**: Renamed the primary entry point `Socialite` to `Connect`.
- **API Optimization**: Changed `RequestBuilder::form` to accept `IntoIterator` to avoid unnecessary memory allocations. If you were passing slices via `.form(&[...])`, you must now pass arrays or vectors directly `.form([...])`.

### Changed
- **Security**: Replaced `debug_assert!` with `assert!` in Google provider to ensure configuration verification runs in release builds.
- **Security**: Upgraded CSRF `state` parameter validation in `AuthCallback` and `AuthSession` to use constant-time comparison via the `subtle` crate, mitigating timing attacks.
- **Internal**: Removed unused `dead_code` macro allowance in `macros.rs` test module.
- **Testing**: Added tests covering `ResponseWrapper::json` deserialization error paths.
- **Testing**: Added missing tests for default trait methods in `HttpClientExt` (`get` and `post`).

### Added
- **Architecture**: Renamed `Socialite` to `Connect` and implemented `Connect::driver`, a dynamic provider factory method allowing initialization of standard OAuth providers by name via string matching.
- **DRY Refactoring**: Introduced `impl_standard_redirect_url!` and `impl_standard_refresh_token!` helper macros, eliminating hundreds of lines of duplicate boilerplate across 30+ providers without introducing breaking changes to the `Provider` trait interface.
- **Testing**: Added unit tests for `fetch_refresh_token` error flows and the `exchange_and_get_user` integration helper.

### Added

- **Testing**: Added unit tests for `fetch_refresh_token` error flows and the `exchange_and_get_user` integration helper.

## [7.0.2] - 2026-06-08

### Security
- **Strict CSRF Enforcement**: Axum Session extractor now strictly requires the `state` parameter in callback queries, returning a `BAD_REQUEST` error if missing, eliminating the bypass vector (FINDING-01).
- **Secure Convenience Methods**: URL-encoded the `state` and `code_challenge` parameters in default trait helper methods of `Provider` to prevent parameter injection (FINDING-02).
- **Safety Assertions**: Promoted macros credential verification guards from `debug_assert!` to standard `assert!`, ensuring validation runs in production/release builds (FINDING-03).
- **Apple Token Retrieval Hardening**: Required `access_token` presence in Apple provider token exchange rather than falling back to an empty string (FINDING-04).
- **GitHub Device Flow Validation**: Enforced presence of `device_code`, `user_code`, and `verification_uri` in GitHub device authorization flow response (FINDING-05).
- **Mock IDP Warning Documentation**: Added warnings to mock identity provider discovery and token handlers explicitly marking `alg: none` as unsafe for production (FINDING-06).

## [7.0.1] - 2026-06-06

### Security & Performance
- **Header Optimization**: Migrated 30+ providers from manual `format!()` string concatenation and Base64 encoding to native `.bearer_auth()` and `.basic_auth()` methods for robust `Authorization` header construction.
- **Async Test Hardening**: Replaced `std::sync::Mutex` with `tokio::sync::Mutex` in test mocks to prevent async lock contention. Replaced unsafe `.unwrap()` with descriptive `.expect()` and idiomatic error handling in tests and docs.

### Security
- **Token Exposure Prevention**: Migrated VK (VKontakte), Facebook, and Instagram providers to use `Authorization: Bearer <token>` HTTP headers instead of exposing `access_token` in URL query parameters, preventing leakage in server logs and proxy caches.
- **Client Secret Protection**: Migrated VK (VKontakte) token exchange from `GET` to `POST` request with a form body, protecting `client_secret` from URL exposure.
- **OIDC Signature Validation Enforcement**: Removed silent fallback to `/userinfo` in Google and generic OIDC providers when `id_token` verification/signature fails, ensuring immediate failure for invalid tokens.
- **Apple Key ID Hardening**: Refactored Apple id_token verification to prevent defaulting Key ID (`kid`) to an empty string, mitigating potential Key Confusion Attacks.
- **DoS/OOM Prevention (HttpClient)**: Imposed a 2MB maximum size limit when reading HTTP response bodies chunk-by-chunk in the default client to protect against Slowloris-style buffer attacks. Clamped `max_retries` to a maximum of 10.

### Resilience & Error Handling
- **Strict Error Handling (Phantom Users Mitigation)**: Extended the elimination of silent failures across all remaining 21 providers (including GitHub, GitLab, Apple, Google, Facebook, etc.). Crucial user identifier fields (like `id` or `sub`) no longer default to empty strings `""` or `0`, returning an explicit `ConnectError::Provider` error if essential user data is missing.
- **Graceful JWT Fallback**: Refactored `OidcProvider`'s `id_token` Key ID (`kid`) extraction to use `.and_then()` instead of `.unwrap_or_default()`, ensuring that missing `kid` headers cleanly fall back to the `/userinfo` endpoint instead of searching for an empty key.

### Added
- **Unit Tests**: Added integration/unit tests for `mock_idp.rs` to guarantee the local mock router properly simulates OAuth2 failure flows (e.g., `invalid_grant` for invalid authorization codes).
- **Unit Tests**: Added comprehensive tests in `src/error.rs` validating `.into()` conversion from standard library and third-party errors (`reqwest::Error`, `serde_json::Error`) into `ConnectError`.

## [7.0.0] - 2026-06-01

### Security & Architecture
- **Dependency Shielding (Blindagem de Dependências)**: Fully isolated the public API from external dependency leaks to protect downstream users from unexpected breaking changes:
  - Refactored `ConnectError` to hold stringified errors (`String`) instead of raw third-party types (`reqwest::Error`, `jsonwebtoken::errors::Error`, `base64::DecodeError`, etc.).
  - Implemented manual `From` conversions for internal convenience of the `?` operator without exposing raw types to consumers.
  - Restricted the visibility of the `jwks` field in `OidcProvider` from `pub` to `pub(crate)` to avoid leaking `jsonwebtoken::jwk::JwkSet` to consumers.

### Security
- **Cryptographic JWT Validation — Apple Provider**: `AppleProvider` now lazily fetches Apple's public JWKS from `https://appleid.apple.com/auth/keys` (cached via `tokio::sync::OnceCell`) and cryptographically verifies the `id_token` signature and claims on every login. Removes the previous unverified base64-decode approach.
- **Cryptographic JWT Validation — Google Provider**: `GoogleProvider` now lazily fetches Google's JWKS from `https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v3/certs` and validates the `id_token` signature. If validation fails (e.g. network error, unknown key), it falls back gracefully to the secure `/userinfo` API endpoint.

### Performance
- **Zero-Allocation Option Mapping**: Replaced `.as_str().unwrap_or("").to_string()` with `.as_str().map(String::from).unwrap_or_default()` across all 34 providers. This eliminates unnecessary heap allocations when a field is absent.
- **Smart Scope Serialization**: Optimized `build_oauth_params` in `src/provider.rs` to skip the `join(" ")` heap allocation entirely when only one scope is requested.
- **No-Clone Secret Generation**: Refactored `AppleClaims` to use lifetime references `AppleClaims<'a>` instead of owned `String`s, removing unnecessary clones during Apple client secret generation.

### Added
- **Mockable `CognitoProvider`**: Refactored to use `Arc<dyn HttpClient>` and exposed `with_http_client` builder method, enabling custom/mock HTTP clients for testing without a real Cognito server.
- **Mockable `OktaProvider`**: Same refactoring as above. Now fully testable offline with any custom client.
- **Mockable `AppleProvider`**: Refactored from `reqwest::Client` to `Arc<dyn HttpClient>` and exposed `with_http_client`, enabling mock-based unit testing.
- **Unit Tests — `RequestBuilder` & `ResponseWrapper`**: Comprehensive tests added to `src/client.rs` covering all builder methods and validating `error_for_status` behavior for standard OAuth error payloads, `message` fields, unknown JSON shapes, and plain-text bodies.
- **Unit Tests — `CognitoProvider` & `OktaProvider`**: Redirect URL unit tests added, verifying correct domain and parameter construction.
- **Unit Tests — `AppleProvider`**: Redirect URL and invalid token handling unit tests added.
- **Unit Tests — `GoogleProvider`**: Redirect URL unit test added.
- **Unit Tests — `OidcProvider::discover` edge cases**: Verifies correct `.well-known` URL construction with and without trailing slashes, and validates descriptive errors on missing OIDC configuration fields.

### Changed
- `ResponseWrapper` now derives `Debug` to support standard Rust test assertion patterns.
- `GoogleProvider` is now defined explicitly instead of via the `define_provider!` macro to support the additional `jwks` `OnceCell` field.

  - `actix-web` `4.9.0` → `4.13.0`
  - `tower-sessions` `0.13.0` → `0.15.0`
  - `wiremock` `0.6.2` → `0.6.5` (dev)

### Internal
- **rand 0.10 Migration** (`src/pkce.rs`): Updated PKCE code to the new `rand 0.10` API — replaced `distributions::Alphanumeric` with `distr::Alphanumeric`, `thread_rng()` with `rng()`, and imported `RngExt` trait for `sample_iter` support.

## [6.1.1] - 2026-05-30

### Fixed
- **Formatting Cleanup**: Reflowed several Rust modules to satisfy `cargo fmt -- --check` and keep CI green.
- **Publish Workflow**: Corrected the crates.io tag filter and added manual workflow dispatch for releases.
- **Release Documentation**: Added a dedicated release guide and aligned the README with the publish flow.

## [6.1.0] - 2026-05-30

### Added
- **OIDC Fast-Path Provider (`OidcProvider`):** Added a generic provider that automatically downloads the OpenID configuration via `.well-known/openid-configuration` and sets up endpoints instantly.
- **Enterprise-Grade Observability:** Native integration with `tracing` crate. Highly detailed spans during token exchanges and profile fetching.
- **Strict Profile Normalization:** Enforced strict typing for `UniversalProfile` (`ConnectUser`), ensuring fields like `email_verified` exist consistently across all 35+ providers.
- **Automated CSRF Protection (`AuthSession`):** Added an Axum Session extractor (behind `axum-session` feature flag) with `tower-sessions` to automatically generate, store, and validate OAuth `state` securely.
- **Native Apple Secret Generation:** `AppleProvider` now dynamically generates the JWT `client_secret` on the fly using a `.p8` Private Key, eliminating tedious script generation for developers.
- **Local Mock IdP:** Added a built-in mock identity provider router (behind `mock-idp` feature flag) powered by Axum, enabling full E2E testing without internet access or rate limits.
- **Device Authorization Flow (RFC 8628):** Support for headless CLI tools and Smart TVs with new `request_device_code()` and `poll_device_token()` methods, fully implemented for GitHub.
- **Cryptographic OIDC Signature Validation:** `OidcProvider` now automatically fetches the provider's JWKS Public Keys and cryptographically verifies the RSA signature of the `id_token` for maximum enterprise security.
- **Unified Provider Errors**: Replaced panic/opaque errors with `ProviderApiError`. HTTP 400s now gracefully parse OAuth 2.0 standard JSON errors (`error`, `error_description`).
- **ORM Integration**: Added the `IntoDatabaseUser` helper trait to easily transform the universal profile into your database models.

### Changed
- **Avatar Standardization**: Improved avatar resolution for Discord (upscaled to 1024px), Google (upscaled to 400px), and X/Twitter (stripped `_normal` suffix for original quality).

### Fixed
- **Mock IdP Build:** Added the missing `base64::Engine` import in `src/mock_idp.rs` so the mock identity provider builds cleanly with the current `base64` API.
- **GitHub Integration Test:** Updated the token error assertion to match the actual `ConnectError::ProviderApiError` shape returned by the client.
- **Clippy Cleanup:** Moved the `src/extractors.rs` test module to the end of the file to satisfy `clippy::items_after_test_module`.
- **Twitch Provider Safety:** Removed the remaining production `unwrap()` in `src/providers/twitch.rs` and now return a proper error when the user payload is empty.
- **Rustdoc Hygiene:** Fixed the bare URL warning in `src/providers/cognito.rs` by formatting it as a proper rustdoc link.

## [5.2.3] - 2026-05-29

### Fixed
- **Formatting**: Fixed trailing blank lines left over by `cargo fix` to appease the strict `-D warnings` on `cargo fmt`.

## [5.2.2] - 2026-05-29

### Fixed
- **Clean Code**: Removed unused `url::form_urlencoded` imports left over from the v5.2.0 refactor, fixing `-D warnings` on the `clippy` CI check.

## [5.2.1] - 2026-05-29

### Fixed
- **CI/CD**: Fixed GitHub Actions permission issue for `rustsec/audit-check` that caused workflow failures.
- **Formatting**: Fixed `cargo fmt` errors on `src/lib.rs`, `src/macros.rs`, and integration tests.

## [5.2.0] - 2026-05-29

### Added
- **Leptos Support**: Integrated Leptos support! By enabling the `leptos` feature, the `AuthCallback` extractor now seamlessly implements `leptos_router::Params`.
- **HTTP Client Agnostic**: The provider traits and builder methods now allow passing a custom `HttpClient` through `.with_http_client(...)`.
- **HTTP Proxy Support**: With the agnostic HTTP client interface, users can now provide a proxy-configured client to navigate locked-down environments easily.

### Refactored
- **URL Generation Boilerplate**: Cleaned up the codebase by removing massive code duplication across all 35 providers for URL generation (`client_id`, `redirect_uri`, `scope`, `state`, `pkce` logic is now unified).

## [5.1.0] - 2026-05-28

### Added
- **Automatic CSRF Validation**: The `AuthCallback` extractor now includes a `verify_state(&self, session_state: &str)` method to automatically secure OAuth flows against CSRF attacks.
- **Refresh Token Support**: Added `token_url()` and `refresh_token(token: &str)` methods to the `Provider` trait and implemented them across all 35 providers, allowing developers to automatically renew expired tokens natively.

### Fixed
- **Testing Dependencies**: Added `serde_urlencoded` to `dev-dependencies` to fix a major compilation bug running the test suite on `main`.

### Security
- Maintained zero `unsafe` footprint while ensuring standard parameter passing for URL token generation and token revocation across providers.

## [5.0.2] - 2026-05-27

### Performance
- **Optimized String allocations**: Replaced `String::new()` with `String::with_capacity(256)` in all 33 providers' `redirect_url` methods, reducing unnecessary reallocations and improving performance.

### Developer Experience
- **Fixed README example**: Corrected compilation bug in the README.md code example (line 103) where the `Err` branch was incorrectly placed inside the `Ok` block.

### Maintenance
- **Removed dead code**: Deleted `src/utils.rs` file which was no longer used after the PR-29 refactoring that inlined URL parameter serialization logic directly into providers.

### Internal
- **Code cleanup**: Removed unused module imports and references to the deleted `utils.rs` module from `lib.rs`.

### Compatibility
- **Breaking Changes**: None
- **API Changes**: None
- **Migration Guide**: No migration required - fully backward compatible with v5.0.1

## [5.0.1] - 2026-05-27

### Added
- **Tokens returned on User**: `ConnectUser` now contains `access_token`, `refresh_token`, and `expires_in` fields so you can interact with the provider's API immediately.
- **Frontend/Mobile Integrations**: Added `get_user_from_token(access_token)` to all providers. This allows your backend to securely fetch the user profile when the OAuth flow is handled natively on the frontend (e.g. mobile apps, React, Vue).
- **Framework Integrations (Axum & Actix)**: Added `axum` and `actix-web` optional features in `Cargo.toml`. Provides native extractors (`AuthCallback`) for seamless URL parsing in route handlers.
- **Token Revocation**: New `revoke_token` method on the `Provider` trait for direct logout at the provider level (reference implementation added for Google).
- **Mocking Tools (TDD)**: Added `MockProvider` to the library to facilitate offline unit testing.
- **Continuous Integration**: Added GitHub Actions (Publish to Crates.io) to automate new version deployments via Tags.
- **Native OIDC Support**: OIDC providers (like Google and Apple) now feature a "Fast Path" that decodes the `id_token` directly via base64, extracting name, email, and photo instantly without making a secondary HTTP request! A massive performance boost.
- **PKCE Support (Proof Key for Code Exchange)**: All providers now have native support for modern PKCE security via the `.with_pkce(code_challenge)` builder method.
- **Prelude Module (`rullst_connect::prelude::*`)**: Added a prelude module for unified imports (ideal for developers and AI assistants).

### Changed
- **Architectural Macros**: All providers now use the internal `define_provider!` macro, which centralizes constructors, state, PKCE, scopes, and reduces hundreds of lines of boilerplate.
- All dependencies have been updated to their latest compatible versions.
- Cleaned up compiler warnings related to unused variables across providers.

## [0.4.0] - Previous stable version
- Initial open-source release with 33 OAuth2 providers supported.
- Standardized `ConnectUser` and async support.
